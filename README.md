# Milestone 1
## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the specifications laid out in the documentation. Your HTML is standards compliant.  The directory structure matches what was outlined. Finally, the content is straightforward and I am able to identify what you want to accomplish and who is your target audience..
##Site Feedback
What you hope to accomplish should be straight foreword. With the emphasis on UI/UX design I caution you not to go overboard with the UI/UX. I recommend laying something out that is simple and elegant for while you are in class and making your PWP more complicated after graduation.
