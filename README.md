Personal Website Project
A professional portfolio used to offer direct communication methods as well as showcase my work.

# Milestone 1
## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the specifications laid out in the documentation. Your HTML is standards compliant.  The directory structure matches what was outlined. Finally, the content is straightforward and I am able to identify what you want to accomplish and who is your target audience..
##Site Feedback
What you hope to accomplish should be straight foreword. With the emphasis on UI/UX design I caution you not to go overboard with the UI/UX. I recommend laying something out that is simple and elegant for while you are in class and making your PWP more complicated after graduation.

# Milestone 2a
## Overall Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone2a. Directory structure, Html, Git history, and content are superb. This is the quality of work I would expect out of a jr developer working underneath me.
### Wireframes
Your Wireframes are clear and easy to understand. With a quick glance I am able to tell what you hope to accomplish and have a clear vision of what your website will look like. The Mobile and Desktop wireframes match and are clearly of the same site(which should translate nicely bootstrap4). I would have liked to see the table of your skills outlined in the about me section.
### Content Strategy
The content strategy is straight foreword and complements your wireframes nicely. I have a clear understanding of what you hope to accomplish.
## Design Tips
Your image carousel should be easy to accomplish using third party plugins. I personally recommend using FancyBox3 since it is easy to use and previous students have had great success using it in the past.

## Moving Foreword
We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Please use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory from here out!
